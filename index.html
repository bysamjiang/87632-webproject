<p class="intro">Looking over Sydney Harbour and with views to the north, Observatory Hill Park is situated near The Rocks, on the land of the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation.<p>
<!-- Paragraph -->
<p>Historically, the site of Observatory Hill was the location for many early Government buildings. From the 1800's, it was the site of a military installation with the construction
of Fort Phillip, the Military Hospital, and a Signal Station that transmitted and received messages to South Head, from ships off the Harbour and coast. It was also the former site
of Fort Street High School.</p>
<p>The locality is named after Sydney Observatory, which went from a singular timeball tower and became a full observatory in 1858. It was initially used to take daily weather records 
of Sydney, until 1922 when a separate weather building was constructed—today, only limited records are taken, due to the development of the city, making measurements unreliable.</p>

<h4>Visiting</h4>
<p>There are several ways to access Observatory Hill Park. From Circular Quay, walking towards The Rocks, you can access the park from Argyle Street—or alternatively, you could take 
Cumberland Street, and walk through a tunnel that cuts across the Harbour Bridge. From Wynyard towards Barangaroo, next to terraced houses and a tennis court, a staircase of 
108 steps—named the Agar Steps—links the park with Kent St.</p>

<!-- Paragraph -->
<h4>The place</h4>
<p>Walking up the road towards the entrance, the morning rush of the city can be watched as cars, trucks, buses, and trains pass by on the adjacent freeway, opposite the fencing that 
enclose the perimeter of the park. Across the freeway on-ramp that divides through the sandstone, situated next-door, is Fort Street Primary School, still sitting in its original
location to this day.</p>
<p>Inside the park, what appear to be fig trees dominate the canopy, with some reaching heights of twenty metres tall. In the rough centre of the park, among the trees, a rotunda 
draws your attention. Built in 1912, and recently restored in 2015, its octagonal floor provides an elevated view of the surroundings.</p>
<p>The park is quiet in the morning, but popular; people sit down and others pass through, some on bicycles. It is a great place to get away from the hustle of the city, 
even if momentarily.</p>
