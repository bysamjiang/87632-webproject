<!-- Paragraph -->
<p>Sydney is a recent invention. The city was built on Aboriginal
land, and the stories of the Sydney clans carry its first and abiding
identities. These weave through in traces and embedded knowledge.
In the centre of the harbour where the water is deepest is the island
Me-mil, a name meaning 'eye'. From here the harbour can be seen
in all directions. The British renamed it Goat Island and used it as a
gunpowder store and for other functional purposes, but its identity
as the harbour's eye has persisted. By thinking of the harbour as
an animate, watching entity, another Sydney comes into being, one
connected to this land's oldest stories.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>There are many versions of Sydney. The architectural miscellany
of the central city; the postcolonial city with the legacy of Indigenous
dispossession; the party city of Mardi Gras and fireworks; the
sprawling suburban network of traffic snarls and local enclaves.
Sydney is all and more of these at once. Its landscapes hold the
memories of everyone whose lives have taken place here, the
imprints of past times and future dreams.</p>

<!-- Paragraph -->
<p>Cities are made up of histories and memories as much as they are
made up of their physical environments. As different as cities can be,
all share the qualities of density and constant change. Traces of the
eras they have passed through can be observed in their details and
felt in the patchwork of atmospheres that shift from place to place.
To write of a city's shadows and undercurrents is to use these details
and atmospheres as thresholds, opening up the repository that is
stored beyond them.</p>
